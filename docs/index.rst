Welcome to Tickompiler's documentation!
=======================================

Tickompiler is a compiler and decompiler for Tickflow, a language constructed from the bytecode format
used by the game Rhythm Heaven Megamix for the Nintendo 3DS to create the sequence of events in its rhythm games and
remixes. Tickompiler allows easy editing of these rhythm games in a more human-readable format.
