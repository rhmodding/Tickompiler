Game Engines
============

This page contains documentation for game engines. Game engines have sets of game-specific Tickflow operations starting at ``0x100``,
as well as subroutines. Game engines can be loaded in remixes and rhythm games using the ``engine`` operation.

   :depth: 2

Spaceball (0)
-------------

Spaceball is the first game engine, with the ID 0. It has several ``0x100`` series operations, which are used for cues,
but no subs that would be useful in remixes.

0x100 - Bat object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    0x100 time, type

An object is spawned (shot out of the pipe) depending on ``type``. Legal values of ``type`` are:

- 0, which spawns a baseball;

- 1, which spawns a rice ball;

- 2, which spawns the alien.

``time`` denotes the time in ticks before the batter has to hit the ball; the time before input. If ``time`` is equal
to ``0x30`` (one beat), the low ball animation is used. Otherwise, the high ball animation is used.

0x101 - Batter costume
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    0x101 costume

The batter's costume is changed depending on ``costume``. Legal values of ``costume``, along with their appearances
in the standard Spaceball cellanim, are:

- 0, which is the default costume;

- 1, which is the "red head" costume;

- 2, which is the bunny costume.

0x102 - Camera zoom
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    0x102<type> distance, time

The camera zooms in or out. ``distance`` is the distance the camera will be at the end of the zoom. It ranges between
0 and ``0xA`` (10), with 4 being the default camera position. The zoom will occur over ``time`` ticks.
``type`` controls the way the zoom is interpolated: 1 gives a linear interpolation, or a rough zoom, and 2 gives a
cubic interpolation, a smooth zoom.

0x103 - Alien animation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    0x103<flag>

``0x103`` controls the animation of the alien in the middle of the screen, namely, ``0x103<0>`` makes it pop out
of its ship, while ``0x103<1>`` makes it return to its ship.

Clappy Trio (1)
---------------

Clappy Trio uses ``0x100`` series operations for the basic building blocks, but bundles them together into subs for
convenience.

0x100 - Clap cue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x100 time

After ``2*time`` ticks, the player has to press the A button to clap.

0x101 - Beat animation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x101 ???

``0x101`` does the beat animation for the clappy trio (head bob). The argument's purpose is unknown, though it seems to be
1 at the end of a set of beat animations, and 0 elsewhere. ::

   0x101<1> num

``0x101<1>`` precedes a set of ``num`` beat animations. Purpose unknown.

0x102 - Ready stance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x102<type>

``0x102`` does the ready stance animation for the clappy trio. If ``type`` is 0, the animation is the regular ready stance.
If ``type`` is 1, the animation is the "determined" ready stance.

0x103 - Clap animation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x103 num

``0x103`` does the clap animation and sound effects for a single member of the trio. ``num`` is the number of the member
to do the clap animation for, from left to right starting at 0. Note that the player's member is unaffected by this operation.

List of subs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

0x56 (async)
   Does a full clap cue, with the claps spaced two beats apart. (no ready stance)

0x57 (async)
   Does a full clap cue, with the claps spaced one beat apart. (no ready stance)

0x58 (async)
   Does a full clap cue, with the claps spaced a half beat apart. (no ready stance)

0x59 (async)
   Does a full clap cue, with the claps spaced a quarter beat apart. (no ready stance)

0x5A (async)
   Does a full clap cue, with the claps spaced an eighth beat apart. (no ready stance)

0x5B (async)
   Does a full clap cue, with the claps spaced two thirds of a beat apart. (no ready stance)

Sneaky Spirits (2)
------------------

Sneaky Spirits bundles ``0x100`` series operations into subs.

0x100 - Shoot cue (?)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x100 ???

A beat after ``0x100``, the input to shoot a spirit occurs. The purpose of the argument is unknown.

0x101 - Draw bow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x101

``0x101`` draws the bow in preparation for a shot.

0x102 - Pop-up spirit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x102 pos

``0x102`` makes a spirit pop up at the specified position on the fence. 0 is the leftmost position and 6 is the rightmost.

0x103 - Close door
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x103

``0x103`` closes the door.

0x104 - Spirit height
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x104 height

``0x104`` sets the height of the spirit, on a scale from 0 to ``0x100`` (256).

0x105 - Spirit position (?)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x105 pos

``0x105`` sets whether the spirit is behind the fence or in the hitzone. If ``pos`` is 1 it's behind the fence,
if it's 0 it's in the hitzone.

0x107 - Reset game speed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x107

``0x107`` resets the game speed after a spirit was hit.

List of subs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are all synchronous subroutines.

0x56
   8-beat spirit cue that stays at max height.

0x57
   8-beat spirit cue that drops off to 0 height slowly.

0x58
   8-beat spirit cue that drops off to 0 height quickly.

0x59
   8-beat spirit cue that drops off to 0 height very quickly.

0x5A
   8-beat spirit cue that starts at 0 height and rises slowly.

0x5B
   8-beat spirit cue that starts at 0 height and rises before dropping back down.

0x5C
   8-beat spirit cue that starts at a low height and drops off slightly before rising.

0x5D
   8-beat spirit cue that alternates between low and high height.

0x5E
   8-beat spirit cue that stays at 0 height.

0x5F

0x61
   7-beat spirit cue that drops off to 0 height quickly.

0x62
   7-beat spirit cue that starts at 0 height and rises slowly.

Rhythm Tweezers (3)
-------------------

Rhythm Tweezers does not pack cues into subs, likely because of the large variety of patterns. It uses
``0x100`` series operations.

0x100 - Spawn Hair
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x100 type

``0x100`` spawns a hair, to be plucked 4 beats later. If ``type`` is 0, spawns a normal hair. If ``type`` is 3, spawns
a long hair.

0x101 - Reset Hair Position
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x101

Resets the position for spawning of hairs. Usually used at the beginning of a pattern.

0x102 - Spawn Tweezers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x102

Spawns tweezers. Used 2 beats after the start of a pattern.

0x105 - Set Vegetable Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x105 type

Sets the type of the next vegetable to appear. 0 gives an onion, 1 a potato.

0x107 - Don't Peek (unused)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x107 type

Makes a sign appear that covers part or all of the hairs. 0 spawns a sign that covers both sides, 1 spawns a sign that covers
the right side, and 2 spawns a sign that covers the left side. While normally the signs automatically despawn after
a pattern, ``0x107<1>`` also despawns them.

Note that this entire command is unused in itself, as well as the graphics associated with it.

Extra notes
~~~~~~~~~~~

At the end of a pattern (4 beats after the start), the following code is found::

   rest 0xA2	// 3.375 beats
   0x108<1>
   if 0
       0xA1<2>
       if 1
           0x106 0
           if 1
               0x105 X
           else
               0x103
           endif
       else
           0x105 X
       endif
   endif
   rest 0x18	// 0.5 beats
   rest 6	// 0.125 beats

The logic and functioning of most of this is unknown, however, the ``0x105`` s here change the type of the next vegetable.
Note as well that input is usually disabled using ``input`` at the start of a pattern, and re-enabled 3 beats later.

Bouncy Road (4)

Built to Scale (0x1C)
---------------------

0x101 - Paddle Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note that when a paddle number is an argument, it's the nth paddle from the left, starting at 0. -1 is off-screen to the left
and 4 is off-screen to the right.

::

   0x101 p1, p2

Used when a peg bounces from paddle ``p1`` to ``p2``. Does the hitting animation for the paddle. ::

   0x101<1>

Paddles reset to their neutral state. ::

   0x101<2> p

Paddle ``p`` charges up. ::

   0x101<3> p

Paddle ``p`` stops charging up.

0x102 - Peg Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x102 p1, p2, ???, cflag, pflag

The peg bounces from ``p1`` to ``p2`` over one beat. If ``p2`` is the player's paddle, includes an input. The third
argument is always 0. If ``cflag`` is 1, it indicates that the paddle at the destination is charged up and will shoot
the peg. If ``pflag`` is 1, it indicates that a charge will occur on the next bounce. ::

   0x102<1> p

Used on the beat the peg will be shot by paddle ``p``. Presumably causes the peg to fall if the player missed.

0x103 - Widget Pair Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x103 slot, active

Sets widget pair slot ``slot`` to active (visible?) if ``active`` is 1, inactive if 0. ::

   0x103<1> slot, i, pos

Moves widget half ``i`` (0 is closer to paddles, 1 is further away) of pair ``slot`` to position ``pos``. Position 0 is
the middle, negative is to the left, positive is to the right. ::

   0x103<2> slot

Combines widget in ``slot`` if the player shoots them correctly the next beat. ::

   0x103<4>

Sets the conditional variable to the number of slots which are active.

   0x102 slot, name

Performs the animation with the name specified by ``name`` (as an ASCII string). It will fade in according to (hardcoded?) rules.
A slot is also specified to allow two to run at the same time. Slot 0 is used for the right side, and 1 for the left.
Animations used in the rhythm game with this operation are:

- ``girl_in_R00``, ``girl_in_R01``

- ``girl_in_L00``, ``girl_in_L01``

- ``lostlove_inL``, ``lostlove_inR`` ::

   0x102<1> slot

The animation in ``slot`` fades out, according to the corresponding ``out`` animation (hardcoded?).

0x103 - Misc. Bear Animations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x103 body, face

Does the animation specified by ``body`` as an ASCII string for the bear's body (or all of the bear), and the animation
specified by ``face`` (again as an ASCII string) for the bear's face. ::

   0x103<1>

Returns the body to the animation ``body_wait`` and the face to the animation ``face_wait`` (crying if necessary). ::

   0x103<2> body, face

Same as ``0x103`` but returns to ``wait`` animations after the animations are done.

0x104 - Crying Flag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x104 f

If ``f`` is nonzero, the bear is now crying. Otherwise, it is not.

0x105 - Wind Animation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x105

Does the ``wind`` animation from the cellanim.

0x106 - Dream Background Switch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x106

Enables the epilogue background showing it was all a dream.

Animal Acrobat (0x35)
---------------------

0x100 - Nothing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    0x100

Do nothing.

0x101 - Intro Stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    0x101

Beat animation. ::

    0x101<1> time

Jump off the initial platform, to grab the first animal in ``time`` ticks.

0x102 - Pattern Loading
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    0x102 delay

Start executing a loaded byte array pattern, with the first animal being grabbed in ``delay`` ticks. This makes the
animals start swinging. ::

    0x102<1> location, size

Loads a byte array of ``size`` bytes, describing the game's patterns. Every byte is an animal. Byte arrays
can be created in Tickflow using the ``bytes`` command. Values for bytes are:

- 0: Single white monkey

- 1: Elephant

- 2: Multiple white monkeys

- 3: Giraffe

- 4: Final platform/end

0x103 - Spotlight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    0x103 f

If ``f`` is nonzero, turns spotlights on, otherwise turns them off.

0x104 - Ending Stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    0x104

The monkey lands. ::

    0x104<1>

The balloon takes off. (used in Jungle Gymnast only)

0x106 - Waterfall
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    0x106 ???

A waterfall appears. The argument is presumably some sort of distance or time argument, and is ``0x21C`` in every instance.

0x107 - Vine
~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    0x107 ???

A vine appears in the foreground. The argument is like in 106, but is ``0x320``.

0x108 - Particle Effects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    0x108

Confetti appears. ::

    0x108<1>

Leaves appear. (at the end of Jungle Gymnast)

Tongue Lashing (0x36)
---------------------

0x100 - Yellow bug control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    0x100

Spawns a yellow bug. Other 0x100 operations (except ``0x100<1>``) crash if this is not executed beforehand. ::

    0x100<1> distO, distP1, distP2, sound

Sets the path for a yellow bug. ``distO`` determines the distance away from the tongue orthogonally that it starts at (in pixels?),
``distP1`` is the distance to the chameleon, parallel to the tongue, at the start of its path, and ``distP2`` is the
distance parallel to the tongue at the end of its path. Note that negative parallel distances are to the front of the
chameleon. ``sound`` determines the sound effect produced when eaten by the chameleon: ``0x1001134`` is the regular
gulp sound, while ``0x1001135`` is a shorter gulp sound. ::

    0x100<2> time

Sets the bug moving toward the chameleon, to be eaten after ``time`` ticks. ::

    0x100<3>

Beat animation. Also applies to red bugs. ::

    0x100<5>

Despawns the bug. Also applies to red bugs.

0x101 - Red bug control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

    0x101

Spawns a red bug. ::

    0x101<1> distO1, distP1, distO2, distP2, distP3, sound

Sets the path for a red bug. ``distO1`` determines the orthogonal distance at the start, ``distP1`` the parallel distance
at the start, ``distO2`` the orthogonal distance when it stops and starts to feint, ``distP2`` the parallel distance at that same
point, and finally, ``distP3`` is the parallel distance when eaten. ``sound`` is like in ``0x100<1>``. ::

    0x101<2> time

Moves the bug to its stopping point over ``time`` ticks. ::

    0x101<4> type

Does a feint. The final feint before it's eaten has ``type`` of 1; maybe slightly more extreme feint? ::

    0x101<5> time

Moves the bug from its stopping point to the tongue, to be eaten after ``time`` ticks. ::

    0x101<6>

Stops the bug?

0x102 - Zoom
~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x102<1> z

Sets the zoom to a factor of ``z/0x100``

0x103 - Chameleon Position
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x103 x, y, tx, ty

Sets the position and target vector of the chameleon. (``x``, ``y``) is the position of the chameleon, and
(``tx``, ``ty``) is the target position, which determines the direction the chameleon is facing. X values are in units
to the right of the middle of the scene; Y values are in units down from the middle of the scene.

0x104 - Chameleon Animations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x104

Beat animation. ::

   0x104<1> start, end, time

The chameleon moves along its target axis. It starts at ``start`` away from its set position along the target axis,
and ends at ``end``. The movement takes ``time`` ticks. ::

   0x104<2> start, end, time, delay

Identical to ``0x104<1>``, but only starts after ``delay`` ticks.

0x105 - Zoom+Position
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x105 z, x, y, tx, ty, delay

This is a combination of ``0x102<1>`` and ``0x103``. It takes place after ``delay`` ticks.

0x106 - Chameleon Grin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x106

Start recording player performance. ::

   0x106<1>

If the player hasn't missed, grin, else do a sad animation. ::

   0x106<2>

Stop recording player performance.

0x107 - Perch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x107<1> type, delay

Changes what the chameleon is perched on after ``delay`` ticks. Values for ``type`` are:

- 0: Hand

- 1: Foot

0x108 - Global Camera Control for whatever reason
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x108 x, y, zoom, delay

Sets the global camera pan to (``x``, ``y``) and the global camera zoom to ``zoom`` after ``delay`` ticks.
Note that this is distinct from the other zoom factor in 103/105.

0x109 - Update Effects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x109

Updates location and size of visual effects to line up with the camera's parameters. If not used, visual effects
will retain the location and size they previously had after a camera change.

0x10A - The two guys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
::

   0x10A i, flag

Sets the specified guy visible if the flag is nonzero, and invisible otherwise. Values for ``i`` are:

- 0: Nose guy

- 1: Cool guy ::

   0x10A<1> i, x, y

Sets the position of guy ``i`` to (``x``, ``y``) ::

   0x10A<2> i, x1, x2, time

Moves guy ``i`` horizontally from ``x1`` to ``x2`` over ``time`` ticks. ::

   0x10A<3>
   0x10A<4>

Parts of the animations after the bug is either eaten or missed. These should be placed 3/4 beats apart.

List of subs
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each is asynchronous.

0x56
   Spawns a yellow bug and does its animations. The "three" sound effect happens two beats after the start, and thus
   the input is 4 beats after the start.

0x57
   Spawns a red bug and does its animations. It starts feinting after 3 beats; the input is after 6 beats.

0x58
   Identical to 0x57, but includes operations for the two guys' animations.
